These are my demo and source files for my session I presented during the PowerShell+DevOps Global Summit in April 2021. :warning: All material is offered **AS-IS** and is for **educational purpose only**.

Some of the demonstrations used code from these modules.

This book, co-authored with Don Jones, is our attempt at writing the definitive guide to PowerShell scripting. The book covers many of the topics I demonstrated in this session, plus much more.
